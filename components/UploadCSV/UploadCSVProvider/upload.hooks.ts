   * @description
   * The `action` will only be dispatched after the transition has started, which ensures that the transition completes before the state change occurs.
   *
   * Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices. With a transition,
   * your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render, which improves the user experience and gives the impression
   * of a smoother transition between UI states.
